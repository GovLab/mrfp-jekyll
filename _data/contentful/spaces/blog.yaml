    MRFP continues to make great progress in the selection process towards the final vendor who will be tasked to build the portal. MRFP reviewed vendor demonstrations in 2016 and obtained additional discovery from finalists beginning in January, 2017. The RFI committee is currently evaluating the finalists. An announcement regarding the selected vendor will be made by the board after final decisions and contract negotiations are complete.

    The current evaluation period follows an [initial RFI](http://mrfpinc.org/rfi.html) from February 2016 seeking input from vendors, government officials, technology and public policy professionals and anyone else with knowledge of platforms, processes, tools and/or methods to simplify the completion and submission of forms—including the submissions of relevant data— and to allow charitable organizations and their professional fundraisers to comply with all states’ registration and annual filing requirements through a unified “one-stop” solution. The RFI remained open for public comment until April 8, 2016. Responses to the RFI can be viewed [here](http://mrfpinc.org/rfi-responses.html).

    In January, the MRFP Board invited four new members to join the Single Portal Advisory Committee:  Christopher Daggett, Ben Getson, Robert Forrester, and Brent Culberson.

    __Christopher Daggett__ and __Ben Getson__ previously served as White House Presidential Innovation Fellows, working with the IRS to reegineer the business process of Form 990 processing, to enable the publishing of electronic nonprofit tax returns online in a machine-readable format. Christopher also worked with the IRS to launch its first crowdsourcing initiative.

    Prior to serving as a PIF, Christopher was the VP of ideas42, a behavioral economics lab spun out of Harvard IQSS, where he worked on projects in consumer finance, health, and tax, as well as led the development of proprietary behavioral design methodologies. He serves on the Board of the Action Design Network, and is also a mentor for Blue Startups, a top 20 accelerator in the US, based in Honolulu, where he assists entrepreneurs with behavioral design, and mobile app design and strategy.

    Ben is a product and technology specialist. Prior to the IRS, Ben was a product management lead at LivingSocial and technology lead at Capitalogix Trading. Ben has worked as a mentor to the startup communities at 1776 in DC and the American Underground in North Carolina. He is now the Director of Product & Technology with the Commerce Data Service within the US Department of Commerce.

    __Robert Forrester__ is President and CEO of Newman’s Own Foundation.  Newman’s Own Foundation is one of the funders for the development of the Single Portal system.  Bob’s 40+ year career has been devoted to philanthropy and support of the global non-governmental/nonprofit sector. A close friend of Paul Newman’s, he was asked by Paul to become the first president of Newman’s Own Foundation when it was created in 2005.  Newman’s Own Foundation provided grant funding for the development and launch of MRFP’s Single Portal Multistate Registration system.

    __Brent Culberson__ was one of the founding directors of MRFP, Inc. during his tenure at the Tennessee Secretary of State’s Office.  Brent left the Secretary of State’s Office last October to develop a new program at his alma mater, Lipscomb University.  As the Director the Office of Neighborhood, Community and Government Relations Brent’s work involves developing and managing the university strategy for cultivating relationships with our neighbors near our campus and other locations throughout the area; to assist university officials in understanding and finding opportunities to serve the community; to stay abreast of state, local and federal higher education policies that could impact the university; to build relationships with government leaders at all levels; and to work with development in securing more funds for research and other programs.

    The Single Portal Advisory Committee (SPAC) is comprised of individuals across the nonprofit and regulatory sector.  Advisory Committee members present observations and make suggestions on behalf of representative constituencies who benefit from, or are subject to and have knowledge of state charities registrations policies, programs and procedures, and the value of open data related to charities and charitable solicitations.  To improve efficiency and to ensure the practical application of the single portal, Committee Members play an important role in advising the board of MRFP.  SPAC meets quarterly, with the most recent meetings taking place on October 17, 2016, and in January 17, 2017. [Learn more about the Advisory Committee](http://mrfpinc.org/people.html)

    Recently, the National Council of Nonprofits featured an overview of the Single Portal filing project on its Blog and encouraged members to offer feedback.  On the need for a single portal:

    *[S]tate laws are not uniform; they differ widely on what triggers registration and what information must be filed. The current process amounts to solving a crossword puzzle of conflicting state laws. For instance, the mere act of sending a fundraising email or text message across state lines could activate registration requirements in some states, whereas other states don’t require registration until a threshold amount is contributed from donors in their state. Complicating matters is that most state laws are built on frameworks written around “old” technologies pre-dating the development of mobile giving.*

    *Recognizing these challenges, a group of state charity regulators started working several years ago on the Single Portal Multi-State Registration project to make it easier for nonprofits to register for fundraising activities in multiple states. Those state charity regulators are committed to launching a beta test site before the end of 2016. To make that happen, many of the state charity regulators currently are in the process of developing a set of common questions that will be asked on the registration forms so the information can be submitted once for use by all participating states, rather than entered separately on different and sometimes conflicting state forms. – See more at: [https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/thought-leadership/new-developments-the-single-portal-multi-state-charitable-registration-project#sthash.rUJXhO9P.dpuf](https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/thought-leadership/new-developments-the-single-portal-multi-state-charitable-registration-project#sthash.rUJXhO9P.dpuf)*

    The announcement of the MRFP Request for Information was met with enthusiasm in a blog post on the Nonprofit Law Prof Blog:

    *If you’ve ever been involved in helping  a charity comply with the various state solicitation registration requirements, then somewhere between swearing and tearing your hair out I’m sure you thought, “There has to be a better way!”  Shake your fist at the sky in despair no more!   It is with unbounded joy that I share part of a note I received from Bob Carlson of the Missouri Attorney’s General Office, who has been actively involved for some time with NAAG and NASCO’s efforts to develop a simplified filing process.*

    *[...]*

    *Seriously awesome work,  Bob and everyone involved with this process.   I am sure I speak for lots of folks when I say that we can’t wait to see this become a reality!*

    The __Multistate Registration Filing Portal, Inc.__ (MRFP, Inc.), a nonprofit corporation comprised of twelve state charity regulators, has received a $30,000 grant from __Newman’s Own Foundation__ toward initial funding for development, launch and testing of “The Single Portal Initiative.”  MRFP’s Single Portal will be an online system that will allow nonprofit organizations and their professional fundraisers to comply with all states’ registration and annual filing requirements through a single online portal (__“The Single Portal Initiative“__).

    “The one-stop service for charity registration, available through MFRP, will be of great value to the nonprofit sector. It is a very practical and welcome way for the states to work together in facilitating good actions, and Newman’s Own Foundation is pleased to help support this program,” said __Bob Forrester__, President and CEO, Newman’s Own Foundation.

    __Bob Carlson__, President of MRFP, Inc. said, “We appreciate the support of Newman’s Own Foundation and its investment in our work.  The Single Portal Initiative is a great example of how states can collaborate and offer efficient and effective service to the nonprofit sector.  This funding will be the first of many steps in creating a tangible site for charities and fundraisers to register and file annual reports and renewals.”

    A twelve state collaboration among Attorneys General, Secretaries of State and Consumer Protection offices, this effort will establish a single point of registration for nonprofit organizations and their professional fundraisers.  The portal will maximize efficiency, data transparency, and information sharing by enabling compliance with registration requirements for all participating states without duplication of data entry. It will make the collected data available to the public in a searchable and interactive format.

    MRFP is pleased to announce that two new states have joined as members.  Mississippi and Georgia join California, Illinois, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, and Tennessee in the initial development of the Single Portal that will then be expanded to include all states that require registration.

    MRFP members are state agencies (Attorneys General, Secretaries of State, or other agencies) with direct oversight responsibility for charitable assets and charitable solicitations.
